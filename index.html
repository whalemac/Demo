            Paragraphs are the building blocks of papers. Many students define paragraphs i
            n terms of length: a paragraph is a group of at least five sentences, a paragraph i<br>
            s half a page long, etc. In reality, though, the unity and coherence of ideas among s
            entences is what constitutes a paragraph. A paragraph is defined as “a group <br>of sentences 
            or a single sentence that forms a unit” (Lunsford and Connors 116). Length and appearance 
            do not determine whether a section in a paper is a paragraph. For instance, in some styles
            imately, a paragraph is a sentence or group of sentences that support one main<br> idea. In this 
            handout, we will refer to this as the “co<br>ntrolling idea,” because it controls what happens in
             the rest of the paragraph<br>
